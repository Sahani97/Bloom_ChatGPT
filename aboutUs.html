                <h2>Welcome to Bloom</h2>
                <p>At Bloom, we are passionate about bringing the beauty, serenity, and vitality of nature into your home. We believe that plants are more than just decoration — they are a source of life, calmness, and joy. Our goal is to make plant care simple, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone, whether you're a seasoned plant enthusiast or just starting your journey with greenery.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Bloom was founded on the idea that every home deserves a touch of nature. In a world where we are constantly surrounded by technology and fast-paced living, we wanted to create a space where people can reconnect with nature, even in the smallest of ways.</p>
                <p>We understand the struggles of plant care—watering schedules, finding the right lighting, and keeping plants thriving—so we set out to provide expert advice, curated products, and inspiration to make plant parenting easier for everyone.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is simple: to help you create a greener, happier home. We want to make plant care effortless and enjoyable so that everyone, no matter their experience level, can bring nature into their space.</p>
                <p>We believe that a home filled with plants is a home filled with life, and we’re here to support you every step of the way on your plant journey. Let’s grow together.</p>
